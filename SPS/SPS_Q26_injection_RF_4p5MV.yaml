# Paramters file for the SPS at injection energy
# Used for LHC beams with old working point (Q26)
# The RMS bunch length corresponds to 3.0ns full bunch length
# THE RF voltage corresponds to the high intensity MDs performed in 2017
# This file is for the study of horizontal head-tail instability observed
# during these MDs, as a comparison point for simulations with Q20 optics.
